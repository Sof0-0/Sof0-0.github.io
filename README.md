I am a fully-funded Master of Science & Engineering (MSE) student at [Princeton University's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/). 

I received a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree (_Summa Cum Laude_) with Honors in Computer Science and Cybersecurity at the Tulane University, New Orleans. Upon my graduation I was inducted into the Phi Betta Kappa and Chi Alpha Sigma Honors Societies. 

My research experience spans machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer architecture, computer systems (focusing on OS and file systems), LLMs, and cybersecurity policy. My current research interests are in **Algorithmic Decision-Making**, **AI and Education**, **Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**.

## Projects
**Honors Thesis: "Enhancing Teaching Methods of File Systems from the Educational Perspective"** 
[[Paper]](https://library.search.tulane.edu/permalink/01TUL_INST/1jgl1pd/alma9945574993306326) \
![File Systems Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/File%20Systems-green) ![Computer Science Education](https://img.shields.io/badge/Computer%20Science%20Education-red)
- Developed an innovative teaching approach that introduces undergraduate students to the concepts of file systems through hands-on experience. WaveFS is a new lab assignment for the Computer Systems and Networking class at Tulane University, focusing on creating a simple Unix-like file system using the File System in Userspace (FUSE) interface. The lab assignment involves implementing basic file system operations to read and write data, as well as manage directories and files.

**Predictive Models for Cyber Threat Trend Analysis** [[Code]](https://github.com/Sof0-0/CyberAttacks.github.io) [[Paper]](https://sof0-0.github.io/CyberAttacks.github.io/)\
![Data Science Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data%20Science-blue) ![Cybersecurity Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cybersecurity-purple) ![ML/AI Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML/AI-yellow)
- Provided insights into cyber threat actors' behavior and motives using machine learning methods, particularly KNN classifiers as well as identified common cyberattack trends using advanced data science techniques. The findings can be used for predictive analysis of future cyber threats and to enhance global threat intelligence.

**MIPS R4000 Simulator for an 8-Stage Pipeline** [[Code]](https://github.com/Sof0-0/MIPS-R4000) \
![Computer Architecture Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Computer%20Architecture-pink) 
- Built a MIPS R4000 simulator (from the MIPS64 family) for an eight-stage pipeline. The processor uses deeper pipeline than the simple 5-stage design. This deeper pipeline allows it to achieve higher clock rates by decomposing the five-stage integer pipeline into 8 stages. Since the cache access stages are usually on the critical path, the extra pipeline stages come from decomposing the memory access stages to achieve more balanced pipeline stages.

**RISC-V Disassembler** [[Code]](https://github.com/Sof0-0/RISC-V-Disassembler) \
![Computer Architecture Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Computer%20Architecture-pink) 
- Built a disassembler that takes in a binary file (or a text file) as input and displays the equivalent RISC-V assembly instructions along with the binary code.
